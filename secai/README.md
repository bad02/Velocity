## A Brief Introduction :book:

Sharing proprietry code is a _tedious task_, one has to either deploy it or package it into a large binary and ship it to end user. SecAI - (_'sekai'_) is a blockchain powered code sharing platform, that would ensure that a user is able to use code without worrying about how to make it work, and developers can rest assured that their code won't be reverse engineered.

## Our Offerings :gift:

> [**SecAI**](https://github.com/God-eye/secAI) - ( _'Sekai'_ ) is a blockchain powered decentralized code sharing platform, that would ensure that a user is able to use code without worrying about how to make it work, and developers sharing their code can rest assured that their code won't be stolen or reverse engineered.

## Roadmap

- [x] Build a smart transaction based system.
- [x] Enable multilingual code support 
- [x] Added a market place.
- [ ] A library for developers to interact with and add their projects also. (Work in Progress)


## Technicalities
   ### Ideal Use Case:
  - We are compiling the code using webassembly into a binary file so that it can run in a web browser with near native speed, these binaries are end to end encrypted and are stored on a decentralized file storage.
  - Any developer who wishes to share their AI will be able to initiate a transaction on [**Matic network**](https://matic.network) that would be answered by the user and thus making it secure and traceable.
  - Transaction will be handeled by [**Portis**](https://portis.io) wallet, which would allow new users to get started fast! :rocket:
   ### Security:
  - The use of [blockchain](https://matic.network) transaction system enforces security as it allows us to use the ethereum security blanket.
  - [Decentralised storage](https://ipfs.io) would allow for potentially faster transfer speeds, as the file is distributed among multiple nodes, this acts as added security layer and elimiates the time and resources wasted in maintaining a file server.

   ### Why Matic?
  - Matic is an ethereum based blockchain and it solves the problems by building a decentralized platform using an adapted version of Plasma framework that provides a solution for faster and extremely low-cost transactions with finality on the main chain.
  - This basically allowed us to speedup our transactions.
